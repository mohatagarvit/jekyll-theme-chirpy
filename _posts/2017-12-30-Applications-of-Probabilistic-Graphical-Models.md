- __Obj__: Studied different applications of message passing algorithms and investigated their use in 5G Communication.
- Decoded Hamming Code transmitted over BSC using BPSK modulation and Monte Carlo simulation.
- Used Sum-Product algorithm to decode Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) Codes using Monte Carlo simulation.
- Used Min-Sum belief propagation for solving Maximum Weight Matching problem in Bipartite Graphs.
- Developed a prototype: communicated noisy motor speed through sensors and denoised it using above algorithms.
- Performed feasibility study on using message passing algorithms as anti-jamming techniques for reducing the problem of Interference in 5G Communication.
