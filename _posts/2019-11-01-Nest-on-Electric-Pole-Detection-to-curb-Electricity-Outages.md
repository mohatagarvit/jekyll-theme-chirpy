- Detected electric poles via InceptionV3 model, developed a custom model to detect nests on already identified poles.
- Used GAN, Neural Style Transfer and standard image augmentation techniques to compensate for small dataset.
- Achieved overall training accuracy of 97% and validation and testing accuracy of 95%. Deployed it on cloud.
