- __Obj__: Study and implementation of variations of the traditional Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithm for image denoising.
- Implemented Pruned NLM (PNLM) algorithm in both MATLAB and mex code, achieving results as published.
- Developed a MATLAB GUI for performance comparison between PNLM and NLM for different noise levels, and neighborhood and patch sizes.
- Assisted in research experiments for removing horizontal and vertical artifacts in Fast Separable NLM; achieved this using bilateral filters and published results.
