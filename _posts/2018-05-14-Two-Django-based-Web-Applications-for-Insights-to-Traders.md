- Developed a novel schema to accommodate disparate financial entities and used a native job scheduler to regularly push financial data under this schema.
- Developed and deployed two end-to-end Django-based web applications to provide traders with analytical and visualization tools for gaining insights.
- First app provides to traders an alternative to view non-modifiable PDFs of daily commodity reports as webpages, while also providing functionalities for easier data manipulation and operation.
- Second one provides capabilities to generate visualization of historical trends of different commodities for different time periods for analytical purposes.
