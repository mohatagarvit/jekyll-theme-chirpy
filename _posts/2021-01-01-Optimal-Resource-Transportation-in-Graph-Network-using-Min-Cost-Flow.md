- Constructed a Network Graph using location, trip information adhering to accessibility and business constraints.
- Used K-Shortest Path Algorithms (Yenâ€™s, Iterative-DFS) to find cost optimal routes based on factors (time, distance, money). 
- Used Network Simplex Algorithm to generate optimal schedule for timely resource availability.
- Accounted for minimum, maximum safety stock limit and customer priority for resource allocation.
