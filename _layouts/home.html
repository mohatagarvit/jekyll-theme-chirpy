    I am currently working as a Data Scientist at SAP Labs India, Bengaluru. 
    I completed my undergraduate (B.Tech) from <a href="https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee" >Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (B.H.U) Varanasi</a>. 
    My B. Tech. project was based on Applciations of Probabilistic Graphical Models under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/kvsrinivas/">Prof. K.V. Srinivas</a> and <a href="https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/eee/people/sghosheee" >Prof. Sandip Ghosh</a>. 
    I also worked in <a href="http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/kunal/">LISA Lab</a> with <a href="Kunal Narayan Chaudhury">Prof. Kunal Narayan Chaudhury</a> on Computer Vision. For more details, please refer to my <a href="{{ 'assets/files/Garvit_Resume.pdf' | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My primary research interests are in Machine Learning, Optimization and Operations Research. 
    Currently, I am excited about the potential of probabilistic and graphical methods in Neural Networks such as Graph Neural Networks, Message Passing Neural Networks, Belief Propagation Neural Networks. 
    I am particularly interested in their applications in decision-making and medical diagnosis.

    Using the principles from <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newton's Deep Work</a> as my guide, I intend to approach my graduate studies with the same fervor and commitment as he did. 
    I like to use my learnings from <a href="https://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/">Charles Duhigg's The Power of Habit</a> to observe habits and routines in nature and organizations and try to develop ones that best suit me.
