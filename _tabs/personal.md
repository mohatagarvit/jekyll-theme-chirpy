## Hobbies
- When I am not studying/working, I like to immerse myself in books or music. Usually, I listen to instrumental piano tracks of Yiruma, Mozart, Beethoven and the like. I also like listening to piano renditions of famous background tracks. 
- On other occasions, I sing English and Hindi songs or engage in playing sports especially badminton.
