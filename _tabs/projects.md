## Study of Applications of Probabilistic Graphical Models
<!-- - Dr. K.V. Srinivas B. Tech. Project|Dec 2017 â€“ Nov 2018  -->
<!-- - Obj:Studied different applications of message passing algorithms and investigated their use in 5G Communication. -->
- Decoded Hamming Code transmitted over Binary Symmetric Channel using BPSK modulation and Monte Carlo simulation.
- Decoded Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) Codes using Sum-Product algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation.
- Solved Maximum Weight Matching problem in Bipartite Graphs using Min-Sum belief propagation.
- Developed a prototype: communicated noisy motor speed through sensors and denoised it using above algorithms.
- Performed feasibility study on using message passing algorithms as anti-jamming techniques for reducing the problem of Interference in 5G Communication.
